[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/b2c9a17c465546b1a90db60ed39cf7dd)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/jfrickson/Url-Share?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=jfrickson/Url-Share&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a browser extension to send links via email. Here are the main features:

1. It uses your `mailto:` handler, so it's completely local to your machine,
not going out to some random server.
1. The email will contain the title of the page, it's url, and optional text
entered by you.
1. Send the email from the extension button or a context menu on the page.
1. Right-click on a link in the current page, and you can send that link.
1. You can send the email with the link immediately, or add it to a queue. If
you're planning on sending multiple URLs, queue them up and send them all at
the same time, in a single email.
1. If you're going to send more than can fit in a single email, URL-Share will
automatically send multiple emails.
1. It keeps a list of email addresses, so you can simply select a recipient
from a drop-down box once it's been entered.
1. For the "Send Now" option on a context menu, it will send to your default
recipient, which you can select or change.
1. You can change the order the URLs will appear in the email, either by
drag-and-drop, or by "Up" and "Dn" buttons.
